I'm Gabriel 

I like fast code, clean UIs, startup ideas, automating the boring stuff, and obsessing over how things *should* work.

I spend most of my time building Toivo, a productivity system that thinks with you and reprogramming how accountants work behind the scenes.

I learn by building, improve by iterating, and chase that feeling when everything finally clicks.

Trying to make something big. Even if it takes a hundred iterations.
