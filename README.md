I'm Gabriel — I like fast code, clean UIs, startup ideas, automating the boring stuff, and obsessing over how things *should* work.

I spend most of my time building Toivo — a productivity system that thinks with you — and reprogramming how accountants work behind the scenes.

I learn by doing, break things often, and chase that feeling when something finally clicks.

Trying to make something big. Even if I have to rebuild it a hundred times.
